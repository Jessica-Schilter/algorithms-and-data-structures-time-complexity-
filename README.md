find time complexity from pseudo-code
What we have: A collection of Sequences of varying lengths from different parts of, letâ€™s say, a chromosome.
What we want to do: Determine which two sequences span the entire chromosome. We want the two
fragments to overlap a little but not too much because it would be a waste of resources.

Develop an algorithm that will allow you to assemble the sequence based on the fragments provided so we
know how they are related ( how they overlap ). After determining the relationship of the sequences, determine
which two sequences span the entire chromosome.
